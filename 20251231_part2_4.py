# 1. Let's create a program along the lines of the example above. This program should print 
#  out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user inputs "no". Then 
# the program should print out "okay then" and finish. Please have a look at the example below.
 #hi
# Shall we continue? yes
# hi
# Shall we continue? oui
# hi
# Shall we continue? jawohl
# hi
# Shall we continue? no
# okay then

ans = 'yes'
while ans == 'yes'
    print('hi\Shall we continue?')

print('okay then')
